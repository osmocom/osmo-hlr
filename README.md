osmo-hlr - Osmocom HLR Implementation
=====================================

This repository contains a C-language implementation of a GSM *Home
Location Register (HLR)*. It is part of the
[Osmocom](https://osmocom.org/) Open Source Mobile Communications
project.

Warning: While the HLR logical functionality is implemented, OsmoHLR
does not use the ETSI/3GPP TCAP/MAP protocol stack. Instead, a much
simpler custom protocol (GSUP) is used.  This means, OsmoHLR is of
no use outside the context of an Osmocom core network.  You can use
it with [OsmoMSC](https://osmocom.org/projects/osmomsc/wiki),
[OsmoSGSN](https://osmocom.org/projects/osmosgsn/wiki) etc. -
but not directly with third party components.
